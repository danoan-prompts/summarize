It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid-gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other. He[Pg 10] came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself, \"Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won't she be savage if I've kept her waiting!\"\nWhen the Rabbit came near her, Alice began, in a low, timid voice, \"If you please, sirâ€”\" The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid-gloves and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.\nAlice took up the fan and gloves and she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking. \"Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual. Was I the same when I got up this morning? But if I'm not the same, the next question is, 'Who in the world am I?' Ah, that's the great puzzle!\""
